# Lab | Comparing regression models


For this lab, we will be using the same dataset for the [customer analysis case study](https://github.com/raafat-hantoush/IH_RH_DA_FT_OCT_2022/blob/main/Class_Materials/Case_Studies/Customer_Analysis_Case_Study/Lab_Customer_Analysis_Case_Study.md) we used in the previous labs. We recommend using the same notebook since you will be reusing the same variables you previous created and used in labs. 

### Instructions

1. fit the models  `LinearRegression`,`Lasso` and `Ridge` and compare the model performances. 
2. (Optional) Define a function that takes a list of models and trains (and tests) them so we can try a lot of them without repeating code.
3. Use feature selection techniques (P-Value, RFE) to select subset of features to train the model with(if necessary).
4. (optional) Refit the models with the selected features.
