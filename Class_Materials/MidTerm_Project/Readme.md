## Mid Term Project

The goal of the midterm project is for you to put into practice what you have learned in the first 4 weeks of the bootcamp. You can therefore choose between a BI project (data visualization) or a Machine Learning project (Linear Regression)
You will have the entirety of week 5 to work on it.
Until Monday, you are asked to find a topic and a dataset for your project.

### Rules:
- Group of maximum of two people per project. Even though it is not recommended, you can work alone on the project.
- Every team has 12 minutes(7 minutes presentation plus 5 minutes Q&A).
- Every team should prepare a well-documented and organized presentation. Although presenting only a Jupyter Notebook is acceptable, we encourage you to prepare additional slides for a better story telling experience.
- By Monday afternoon we need you to submit a general plan for your project. To do this, first create a new Github repository dedicated for the midterm project, containing a readme file. The readme should be brief (half page or max 1 page) containing the following: (Please don't forget to submit the URL to your project repository on the student portal)

     + Members of the group
     + Goal of the project, what you want to achieve. Please specify if it is a modelling or BI project
     + Brief description of the dataset (Source, Number of rows, number of features)
     + High-level Planning of the project, e.g:
         - Day 1 - EDA
         - Day 2 - Clean the data
           - Remove typos of
           - Correct datatypes
           - ...
        - Day 3 
          - Transform the data
          - Scale Numerical Features
          - Encode Categorical Features
          - ...
        - Day 4 - Modelling
          - Split data
          - ...
          - Etc

Notes:
- Please when choosing the data set for your project, please make sure to explore and investigate the data first to check if it is useful for your analysis. For instance:
  +  checking the number of rows(preferrably in thousands of observations)
  +  you need to check if it is full of missing values or not,
  +  checking the data type of the target variable(in case of modeling project)
  +  Also  in case of multiple tables or csv files, make sure that the data is joinable( meaning having matching keys to join the data between these tables).
  +  (for the modeling project) Important: checking if the target variable is a continuous(numerical) variable(meaning regression)  or discrete(categorical) variable (meaning classification)
  +  (for the BI project), you dont need to include every single chart you could think of, you have to prioritize the most important patterns/insights that add value to the end use, helping you in telling the data story.

In case, by monday, you haven't found any dataset/project topic that interests you, you can choose one of these two options:
1. Modeling project: Real estate modeling project (see the project folder)
2. Business Intelligence Project: Olist Business Intelligence Project (see the project folder)
